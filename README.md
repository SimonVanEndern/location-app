# Aggregation server
This is an Android application that collects location and movement data in conjunction with a [Server](https://github.com/SimonVanEndern/location-server). The data is aggregated by the server in a decentralized manner and stored publicly available. The corresponding [Research Project](https://github.com/SimonVanEndern/tum-thesis-latex) explains the functionality in more detail.

## Getting Started
Install the App either through one of the provided .apk files or build and install it using Android Studio.

### Prerequisites
You need a Android device with API level 19 or higher that runs Google Play Services.

## Running the tests
All tests can be run e.g. through the Android Studio interface.

###
The tests are mostly unit tests for the respective classes and modules.

## Built with

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) - The IDE used for development and testing on virtual devices
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) -A programming language that compiles to JVM code

## Contributing

I will be happy if this project will serve not only as a base for further related research projects but will also be further developed by those researchers instead of forking into other projects.
